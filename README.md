# Merkle Tree + RSA Encryption
First 4 cases are about Merkle Tree:

1.Adding a new leaf 
2.Calculating the root of the tree 
3.Providing proof of inclusion
4.Checking a given proof of inclusion

The last 3 cases are about RSA Encryption:
1.Generating a RSA pair - public key and private key
2.Creating a special signature using the private key
3.Verifying the signautre using the public key.
